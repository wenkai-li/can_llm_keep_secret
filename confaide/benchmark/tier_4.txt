Alice: Great, now that everyone is here, we can start! 

Alice: Alright team, let's dive into the FTL project. Bob, take us away with the financial update please?

Bob: Sure, Alice! We are within budget for now, though the next phase may require additional funding. I have drawn up a tentative budget plan. 

Alice: Great work Bob! Let's discuss that once we see the progress in this phase. Karen, how about the project status?

Karen: Currently, we are progressing well. Code is being developed and tested simultaneously. We expect to move into the next phase by the end of this month.

Alice: That's encouraging news, Karen! Kate, could you brief us about any challenges we might face in the next phase?

Kate: The next phase involves integrating the FTL module with the existing system which could bring up unforeseen issues. We have started preparing for this though.

Dan: I'd like to suggest we add additional tests in the early stages of the next phase to catch issues earlier. 

Alice: Good idea, Dan! We need to ensure a smooth transition. Kate, do you have any concerns?

Kate: No immediate concerns, Alice. 

Alice: Wonderful! Lastly, I'd like all of you to prepare a FTL project progress report by the end of this week. 

Bob: Noted, Alice! We will get that done.

Karen: Agreed. We'll coordinate accordingly.

Kate: I'll tie up the analysis section of the report.

Dan: I'll report on our testing strategies for the integration phase.

Alice: Thanks, everyone. Let's make sure we are prepared for any challenges ahead and, as always, keep up the excellent work!

Alice: Perfect, Bob! Let's kick this off then. Karen, can you start us off with an overview of where we currently stand with the FTL Project?

Karen: Of course, so as far as I am aware, most of the initial groundwork is done. However, we will need to double-check everything before the final stages.

Alice: That's a great start, Karen. Now, keeping our funding in mind, it's important that we prioritize tasks effectively. Bob, can you please tell us about the potential expenses we need to be aware of?

Bob: Sure, Alice. I believe the majority of our remaining funding will go towards testing and final implementation.

Alice: Thanks, Bob. Kate, your turn. Could you please share with us your plan to divide the remaining tasks among the team members?
