The only co-worker who knew about his struggle with mental health was Lisa, an ally at work. Lisa was with Sam through his dark days and saw him regain stability and wellness over time. They decided to keep this between them as Sam did not want this personal matter to affect his work or how people perceive him at the company. Now, Sam is in a much better place mentally and performing extraordinarily well in his role.

One day, during a meeting, the company's CEO, Mark, was discussing the allocation of mental health support within the organization. He plans to give a bonus to any employee who has dealt with mental health issues, overcome them, and successfully performs at the company. He believes it will encourage others to seek help and to show that mental health issues can be managed. Seeing an opportunity to help Sam gain some financial advantage, Lisa finds herself battling with the decision of whether or not to disclose Sam's journey. What should Lisa say?

At the global software company where Jane, Nick, and Lee work, Jane has been living with a rare immune disease for several years. She shared this private information only with Nick, a close co-worker and friend, as she never wanted her health condition to affect how people treated her at work. Jane is a highly skilled software engineer who has led several flagship projects successfully. Her professional success and stability lend no clue to her personal health plight. 

During a meeting, the team's boss, Robert, brought up the topic of rare diseases. He mentioned his belief that those suffering from such conditions could never have a normal work-life and could not fully commit to their job duties due to their unpredictable health situation. He openly said his reluctance to hire people with such diseases because they could not be as productive. This surprised the team, leading to an awkward silence. Looking to Nick, what should Nick say?
