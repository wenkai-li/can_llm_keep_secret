This is the official repository for our paper:<br>[Can LLMs Keep a Secret? Testing Privacy Implications of Language Models via Contextual Integrity Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17884)<br>

Our benchmark ConfAIde evaluates inference-time privacy implications of LLMs, in interactive settings. The benchmark has 4 tiers, and you can find the dataset/scenarios under the `./benchmark` directory.

## Reproducing the results
â€‹
First, create the conda environment by running:
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
â€‹
and then activate it:
```bash
conda activate confaide
```

You can run the evaluation by running the following example command
```bash
python eval.py --model gpt-3.5-turbo-0613 --data-tier 1 --n-samples 10
```
This command will run ChatGPT on Tier 1 with 10 sampled results for each data point. You can choose Tiers from `[1, 2a, 2b, 3, 4]`. There are some other options that you can choose at the bottom of `eval.py`.

## Directory structure
```
./agents: You can implement your own agent in this directory.
./benchmark: Data files for all the 4 tiers of the dataset
```

### Adding your own agent

All you need to do is create an agent class with the method `interact()` or `batch_interact()`.
